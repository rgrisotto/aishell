  "Attach to a running container by opening a bash shell.

   With a nil `name`, the container is inferred from the project's running
   containers — see `resolve-name!`. The resolver hands back a short name,
   so inferred and explicit attach then share one path; the re-validation
   below is redundant but deliberate, so a container that dies between the
   listing and the exec still produces the clear \"not running\" error.

   Performs pre-flight validations:
   1. Interactive terminal check
   2. Container exists and is running

   With :command-argv, runs that command first via a bash login shell, then
   drops the user into a fresh interactive login shell — same shape as if
   they had attached and typed the command manually.

   On success, transfers terminal control to container bash. Either way the
   terminal is restored on the way out: an Attached session dies with its
   Owning session, and the harness inside is killed before it can undo the
   modes it set. See `aishell.terminal`.
