;; Build aishell release assets
;; Usage: ./scripts/build-release.clj [--target all|host|<platform>]
;;
;; Produces one archive per platform, each holding a single standalone
;; executable - the upstream babashka binary with aishell's uberjar appended,
;; named `aishell` or `aishell.exe` - plus a SHA256SUMS file:
;;   dist/aishell-linux-amd64.tar.gz
;;   dist/aishell-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
;;   dist/aishell-macos-amd64.tar.gz
;;   dist/aishell-macos-aarch64.tar.gz
;;   dist/aishell-windows-amd64.zip
;;   dist/SHA256SUMS
;;
;; Archived because the native image compresses to about a third of its size;
;; the jar inside is already deflated and contributes nothing.
;;
;; And, while the legacy gate below is on, the pre-4.1.0 trio:
;;   dist/aishell        - Executable uberscript with shebang
;;   dist/aishell.bat    - Windows CMD wrapper
;;   dist/aishell.sha256 - SHA256 checksum of dist/aishell
;;
;; Version is defined in src/aishell/cli.clj - update there before release.
