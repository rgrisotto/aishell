# aishell

Docker sandbox for running AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi) in ephemeral containers.

## Why Docker?

AI coding agents run arbitrary code — installing packages, writing scripts, deleting files — with
minimal human review. On your host machine, one bad command can reach your SSH keys, cloud
credentials, browser data, and every file you own.

Docker draws a boundary. The agent sees only what you mount: your project directory and its config
files. It cannot touch `~/.ssh`, overwrite your shell config, or install packages that outlive the
session. When the agent exits, the container disappears. Nothing accumulates.

A fixed base image also means every developer runs agents in the same environment — no "works on my
machine" failures. And if you run multiple agents simultaneously, each gets its own container with no
shared state.

## Why aishell?

Running AI coding agents in Docker means dealing with:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$PWD:$PWD" \
  -v "$HOME/.claude:/home/dev/.claude" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/claude-code:/home/dev/.config/claude-code" \
  -w "$PWD" \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  --name claude-session \
  my-claude-image claude
```

And that's the simple version. You still need to:

- **Get paths right** - AI agents reference absolute paths. If `/home/you/project` on your host becomes `/app` in the container, file references break.
- **Preserve git identity** - Without setup, commits appear as "root" or "unknown". You need to pass through `.gitconfig` or set `GIT_AUTHOR_*` variables.
- **Reproduce across machines** - That 200-character docker command you perfected? Good luck remembering it on your laptop.

aishell handles all of this. One command, consistent behavior, works everywhere.

### Why not devcontainers?

Devcontainers solve a different problem. They create persistent development environments tied to your IDE.

aishell is purpose-built for AI agents:

- **Ephemeral by design** - Containers spin up, run the agent, and disappear. No state accumulates, no cleanup needed.
- **Host path preservation** - Devcontainers remap your project to `/workspaces/project`. When an AI agent says "edit `/home/you/project/src/main.ts`", that path needs to exist. aishell mounts your project at its real path.
- **CLI-first** - No IDE required. Run from any terminal, SSH session, or script.
- **Zero config for the common case** - `aishell claude` just works. Devcontainers require `devcontainer.json`, features configuration, and IDE integration.

You can use both: devcontainers for your development environment, aishell for running AI agents.

## Quick Start

### Unix/macOS/Linux

```bash
# 1. Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniSoma/aishell/main/install.sh | bash

# 2. Build foundation image and select harnesses (one-time)
aishell setup --with-opencode

# 3. Run
aishell opencode
```

### Windows

**Recommended:** Use WSL2 and follow the Unix/Linux instructions above — it provides the best experience. Otherwise, use PowerShell. CMD works but has limited error handling and no colored output.

#### PowerShell

```powershell
# 1. Install
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniSoma/aishell/main/install.ps1 | iex

# 2. Restart terminal, then build foundation image and select harnesses (one-time)
aishell setup --with-opencode

# 3. Run
aishell opencode
```

#### CMD

```batch
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniSoma/aishell/main/install.bat -o install.bat && install.bat

aishell setup --with-opencode

aishell opencode
```

> Requires Windows 10 version 1803 or later.

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites & troubleshooting</summary>

**Requirements:**

- **Linux/macOS:** Docker Engine
- **Windows:** Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend enabled

aishell ships as a single executable carrying its own babashka. Docker is the only thing you install yourself.

**Docker:**
- Linux/macOS: Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Windows: Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and enable WSL2 backend (Settings → General → "Use the WSL 2 based engine")

**Binaries downloaded through a browser:**

The install scripts fetch the binary with curl or PowerShell, and those downloads carry no quarantine flag. A browser download does, and the binaries are not code-signed yet. If you downloaded one from the releases page in a browser, clear the flag before you run it.

macOS:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/aishell-macos-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Windows: right-click the downloaded zip, open Properties, and check "Unblock" before you extract it. From PowerShell:

```powershell
Unblock-File .\aishell-windows-amd64.zip
```

**Running aishell on your own babashka:**

The release binaries carry their own babashka, so you do not need one. To run aishell on the babashka you already have, install it from the git repository with [bbin](https://github.com/babashka/bbin):

```bash
bbin install io.github.UniSoma/aishell
```

**PATH configuration:**

Unix/macOS - Add `~/.local/bin` to PATH if not already present:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Windows - After installation, add the directory containing `aishell.exe` to PATH:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\aishell", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

Then restart your terminal.

**Updating harness tools:**

```bash
# Unix/macOS/Linux
aishell update

# Windows (PowerShell or cmd.exe)
aishell update
```

</details>

## How it works

When you run `aishell claude`, aishell launches an ephemeral Docker container with your project mounted at its real host path so file references stay valid. Your git identity and harness configs (e.g. `~/.claude`) are passed through automatically. Any per-project customization from `.aishell/` is applied. When the agent exits, the container disappears — only your project files and harness configs persist.

## Features

### Core

- **Isolated execution** - AI agents run in ephemeral Docker containers
- **Host path preservation** - Projects mounted at their real host path so file references stay valid
- **Git identity passthrough** - Commits preserve your identity
- **Config persistence** - Mounts `~/.claude` and OpenCode configs

### Customization

- **Global base image** - Customize the base image for all projects via `~/.aishell/Dockerfile` (extra system packages, shell config, dev tools). See [Configuration docs](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#global-base-image-customization) for details.
- **Per-project customization** - Extend via `.aishell/Dockerfile`
- **Runtime configuration** - Custom mounts, env vars, ports via `.aishell/config.yaml`
- **Version pinning** - Lock harness versions for reproducibility
- **Pre-start commands** - Run sidecar services before shell/harness

### Power user

- **Sensitive file detection** - Warnings before AI agents access secrets, keys, or credentials
- **Gitleaks integration** - Opt-in deep content-based secret scanning with `aishell gitleaks` (requires `--with-gitleaks`)
- **One-off commands** - Run single commands in container with `aishell exec`
- **Named containers** - Deterministic naming with `--name` override
- **VSCode integration** - Open VSCode attached to a container as `developer` with `aishell vscode`, server state persisted across restarts
- **Attach** - Open a shell in a running container via `aishell attach`; the name is optional when only one is running
- **Container discovery** - List project containers with `aishell ps`
- **Volume management** - List and prune orphaned harness volumes with `aishell volumes`
- **Image info** - Show image stack and installed tools with `aishell info`
- **Update notifications** - Automatic check for newer versions (configurable interval, disable via `update_check` in config)
- **Self-upgrade** - Update aishell itself with `aishell upgrade`, with checksum verification

## Usage

### Set up harnesses

```bash
# Set up with a single harness
aishell setup --with-claude
aishell setup --with-opencode
aishell setup --with-codex
aishell setup --with-copilot
aishell setup --with-gemini
aishell setup --with-pi

# Set up with multiple harnesses
aishell setup --with-claude --with-opencode --with-codex --with-copilot --with-gemini --with-pi

# Set up with specific versions
aishell setup --with-claude=2.0.22
aishell setup --with-codex=0.1.2025062501
aishell setup --with-copilot=0.0.339

# Reuse the last saved setup config, overriding only what you specify
aishell setup --reuse-config
aishell setup --reuse-config --with-opencode       # reset OpenCode to latest
aishell setup --reuse-config --with-opencode=1.2.3 # override inherited version
```

### Run harnesses

```bash
# Enter interactive shell
aishell

# Run a harness
aishell claude
aishell opencode
aishell codex
aishell copilot
aishell gemini
aishell pi

# Pass arguments to harness
aishell claude --help
```

### One-off commands

Run commands in the container without entering interactive shell:

```bash
aishell exec ls -la
aishell exec npm install
aishell exec node --version

# Use with pipes
echo "hello" | aishell exec cat
cat package.json | aishell exec jq '.scripts'
```

**Note:** The exec command uses the same mounts and environment from your config.yaml, but skips pre-start hooks and sensitive file detection for fast execution.

### Multi-container workflow

Run multiple containers and reconnect later:

```bash
# Start Claude in a second terminal
aishell claude --name reviewer

# List running containers for this project
aishell ps

# Open a shell in a running container
aishell attach reviewer

# With only one container running, the name is optional
aishell attach

# Stop a container (use `aishell ps` to find the container name)
docker stop <container-name>
```

Containers are named `aishell-{project-hash}-{name}`. Use `aishell ps` to discover container names for your project.

**Conflict detection:** Starting a container with a name already in use by a running container shows an error with guidance. Stopped containers with the same name are auto-removed.

### VSCode (Experimental)

Open VSCode attached to the container as the `developer` user — no manual configuration needed:

```bash
# Open VSCode attached to the container (blocks until window closes, then stops container)
aishell vscode

# Detached mode: container keeps running in the background
aishell vscode --detach

# Stop a detached container when done
aishell vscode --stop

# Pass extra arguments through to the 'code' CLI
aishell vscode --profile Work
aishell vscode --detach --disable-gpu
```

By default, aishell waits for the VSCode window to close, then stops the container automatically. Use `--detach` to leave the container running in the background. Multiple `aishell vscode` instances can run simultaneously — each opens a dedicated window.

Any arguments not recognized by aishell (`--detach`, `--stop`, `--help`) are passed through to the `code` CLI. You can also set persistent defaults via `harness_args.vscode` in your [config](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#harness_args).

The `~/.vscode-server` directory is mounted into the container, so VSCode server extensions and cached data persist across container restarts.

**Prerequisites:** VSCode with `code` CLI on PATH and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed. On WSL2 with Docker installed inside the distro (not Docker Desktop), see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#symptom-vscode-dev-container-cant-find-docker-on-wsl2-no-docker-desktop).

### Upgrade aishell

```bash
# Upgrade to latest version
aishell upgrade

# Upgrade to a specific version
aishell upgrade 4.1.0
```

`aishell upgrade` downloads the archive for your platform, checks it against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, and unpacks the binary inside before it replaces anything. Linux and macOS use the system `tar`; on Windows the zip is read in-process. At a terminal it shows a progress bar; from a script it prints the download size instead. Asking for a version below 4.1.0 fails the download: those releases published a script that needs babashka, not a binary for your platform.

Upgrading from a 4.0.0 script install replaces the script in place, so your PATH entry stays as it is. On Windows it writes `aishell.exe` and deletes the old `aishell` and `aishell.bat`, and says so.

Windows cannot overwrite a running executable, so upgrade renames the current `aishell.exe` to `aishell.exe.old` and puts the new one in its place. The next time you run aishell, it deletes the leftover.

### Update harness tools

```bash
# Refresh harness tools (volume refresh, fast)
aishell update

# Refresh harness tools AND rebuild foundation image
# (also recreates the harness volume)
aishell update --force

# Rebuild setup layers from the saved setup config,
# without update's unconditional volume repopulation
aishell setup --reuse-config --force
```

### Validate setup

Run pre-flight checks without launching any container:

```bash
aishell check
```

Checks Docker availability, build state, image existence, configuration validity, mount paths, sensitive files, gitleaks scan freshness, and tool availability (git, VSCode `code` CLI).

## Configuration

### Project customization

Create `.aishell/Dockerfile` to extend the foundation image:

```dockerfile
FROM aishell:foundation

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-client
```

### Runtime configuration

Create `.aishell/config.yaml` to configure container runtime:

```yaml
# Inherit from global config (default: "global", or "none" to disable)
extends: global

mounts:
  - /path/to/data
  - source: $HOME/.secrets
    target: /secrets

env:
  DATABASE_URL: passthrough
  MY_VAR: literal_value

ports:
  - "3000:3000"
  - "8080:80"

docker_args: "--memory=4g --cpus=2"

pre_start: "redis-server --daemonize yes"
```

### Config inheritance

Project configs merge with `~/.aishell/config.yaml` by default. See [Configuration docs](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for merge strategy details. Set `extends: none` to disable inheritance.

> **Tip:** `.sandbox/` is a full alias for `.aishell/` if you prefer no "ai" naming in your repo — put your `Dockerfile`/`config.yaml` there instead. Use only one of the two. Scaffold it with `aishell setup --dir .sandbox`. The global config dir stays `~/.aishell/`, and a `.sandbox` repo still inherits `~/.aishell/config.yaml`.

## Security

### Sensitive file detection

Before launching a container, aishell scans your project for potentially sensitive files and warns you before AI agents can access them.

```
$ aishell claude
⚠ Sensitive files detected:

  HIGH: SSH private key
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa

  MEDIUM: Environment file
    .env
    .env.local

Proceed? (y/n)
```

**Bypass for CI/automation:**

```bash
aishell claude --unsafe  # Skip confirmation prompts
```

### Gitleaks (Optional)

Gitleaks is opt-in. Enable it at build time:

```bash
aishell setup --with-claude --with-gitleaks
```

Then use `aishell gitleaks` for content-based secret detection inside the container:

```bash
aishell gitleaks detect
aishell gitleaks detect --verbose --no-git
```

aishell tracks when you last ran gitleaks and reminds you if it's been more than 7 days.

For custom detection patterns, allowlists, and freshness configuration, see [Configuration docs](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Authentication

aishell mounts harness configuration directories from your host (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.pi`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`), so authentication persists between container sessions.

### Claude Code

**Option 1: Interactive OAuth**

Run `aishell claude` and follow the prompts. Claude Code displays a URL you can copy-paste into your browser, completing OAuth even from within the container.

**Option 2: API Key**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
aishell claude
```

### Codex CLI

**Option 1: Interactive OAuth**

Run `aishell codex` and select "Sign in with ChatGPT". In headless environments, use:

```bash
codex login --device-auth
```

This displays a code to enter at a URL in your browser.

**Option 2: API Key**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # For login
# or
export CODEX_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # Only works with `codex exec`, not interactive
aishell codex
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Run `aishell copilot` and follow the device-code sign-in flow. Login, settings,
plugins, saved permissions, and sessions persist in host `~/.copilot`.

For token authentication, aishell automatically forwards only
`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `COPILOT_GH_HOST` when Copilot is enabled. Broader
GitHub variables such as `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `GH_HOST` require an
explicit `env:` entry. Copilot's self-updater is disabled in the Sandbox;
use `aishell update` so the configured version stays authoritative.

Persistent defaults under `harness_args.copilot` apply to both
`aishell copilot` and the `copilot` alias inside an interactive Sandbox. aishell
does not add `--allow-all` or `--yolo`.

### Gemini CLI

**Option 1: Authenticate on host first**

```bash
# On your host machine (not in container)
gemini  # Select "Login with Google"

# Then run in container - credentials are mounted
aishell gemini
```

**Option 2: API Key**

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# or
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
aishell gemini
```

**Note:** Gemini CLI does not support device code flow for container authentication. Either authenticate on host first, or use an API key.

### Pi

Pi uses its own configuration-based authentication. Set up authentication on your host:

```bash
# Authenticate on host first, then credentials persist in ~/.pi
pi auth
```

The container mounts `~/.pi` automatically.

### OpenCode

OpenCode configuration directories (`~/.config/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`) are mounted from your host. Refer to OpenCode's documentation for authentication methods.

## Environment Variables

aishell automatically passes harness-specific API keys to containers when the corresponding harness is enabled and the variable is set on your host. Other variables (AWS, GitHub, etc.) must be passed explicitly via the `env:` section in `config.yaml`.

### Auto-Passed (per enabled harness)

| Variable | Harness | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude, OpenCode | Required for API key auth |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Codex, OpenCode | Used by multiple harnesses |
| `CODEX_API_KEY` | Codex | Only works with `codex exec` mode |
| `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Copilot CLI | Token authentication |
| `COPILOT_GH_HOST` | GitHub Copilot CLI | Enterprise Cloud/data-residency host |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini | From Google AI Studio |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Gemini | Alternative to GEMINI_API_KEY |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Gemini | Path to JSON key file (Vertex AI) |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | Gemini | Required for Vertex AI |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | Gemini | Required for Vertex AI |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | OpenCode | For Groq-hosted models |
| `OPENCODE_API_KEY` | OpenCode | OpenCode Zen model router |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenCode | For Azure-hosted models |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | OpenCode | For Azure-hosted models |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Pi | Override pi's working directory |

### Set by aishell

These are not read from the host. aishell sets them in every sandbox where the
harness is enabled, so `aishell update` and version pins stay authoritative; a
`config.yaml` `env:` entry of the same name loses to them and `docker_args` is
the escape hatch (see
[ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-harness-owned-runtime-environment-precedence.md)).

| Variable | Harness | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` | Claude | Autoupdater off |
| `COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false` | GitHub Copilot CLI | Self-update off |
| `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=true` | Pi | Startup version check off |

Codex CLI gets the same policy through argv (`-c
check_for_update_on_startup=false`). Gemini CLI and OpenCode offer it only in
their own config files, which aishell mounts rather than writes.

### Require Explicit config.yaml `env:` Section

These variables are **not** auto-passed. Add them to your `config.yaml` to forward them into containers:

```yaml
env:
  GH_TOKEN: passthrough
  GH_HOST: passthrough
  GITHUB_TOKEN: passthrough
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: passthrough
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: passthrough
  AWS_REGION: passthrough
  AWS_PROFILE: passthrough
```

| Variable | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub API access | For GitHub operations |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access | Not auto-passed |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret | Not auto-passed |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region | Not auto-passed |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | AWS profile | Named profile support |

### Host-Side Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `AISHELL_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` | Claude permissions | Set to `false` to enable prompts (read on host, not passed to container) |
| `AISHELL_RELEASE_URL` | Alternate release tree | Base URL for release assets, default `https://github.com/UniSoma/aishell/releases`. The install scripts, `aishell upgrade` and the update check all read it |

## Reference

### Foundation image contents

Built on `debian:trixie-slim` (glibc 2.41; the build asserts a floor of 2.39 — see `docs/adr/0005-glibc-floor-on-the-distro-image.md`) with:

**Runtimes:**
- Node.js 24 (with npm, npx)
- Babashka
- bbin (shared install dir at `/usr/local/share/bbin`, writable by both root at build and the developer user at runtime)
- OpenJDK 21 JRE (headless) — required by bbin's `tools.deps` dep resolution
- CUE v0.17.1 — data validation, configuration, and code generation
- uv v0.11.29 — Python package and toolchain manager (`uv`, `uvx`); no interpreter is baked, uv fetches the version a project pins on demand
- SQLite 3.53.4 — compiled from upstream source, not Debian's 3.46.1. Ships
  `sqlite3`, `sqldiff` and `sqlite3_rsync`, plus the shared library, header and
  pkg-config file under `/usr/local`. The library is `ldconfig`'d ahead of
  Debian's, so anything in the container that links `libsqlite3.so.0` gets
  3.53.4 too. `sqlite3_analyzer` is not included: it is the one tool that
  requires TCL

**Security tools:**
- Gitleaks v8.30.0 (optional, via `--with-gitleaks`)

**CLI tools:**
- git, ssh, patch, curl, jq, ripgrep, fd, vim
- tree, less, file, watch
- htop, sudo, rlwrap
- zip, unzip, zstd, xz

`ssh` needs your host keys mounted to be useful — see
[mounts](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#mounts).

**Document & data tools:**
- `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`, `pdfinfo`, `pdfimages` (poppler) — extract text from
  PDFs (`-layout` preserves tables), pull page ranges out of large documents, and
  rasterize pages to images. CJK CMap tables are included, so PDFs without
  embedded fonts extract correctly
- `xmllint` — validate XML/HTML and query it with XPath
- `sponge`, `ts`, `chronic`, `ifne` (moreutils) — `sponge` soaks up stdin before
  writing, making `cmd file | ... | sponge file` safe where `> file` would
  truncate the input first

**Harness tools** (npm packages, binaries) are mounted from volumes at `/tools`, not baked into the image.
This allows harness updates without rebuilding the foundation image.

### Git safe.directory

When you run a container, aishell configures git to trust the mounted project directory by adding it to `safe.directory` in the container's gitconfig.

**What happens:**
1. The entrypoint runs `git config --global --add safe.directory /your/project/path`
2. This writes to `~/.gitconfig` inside the container

**Host gitconfig impact:**
If you mount your host's `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config` into the container (via `mounts` in config.yaml), the safe.directory entry will be added to your **host's** gitconfig file.

**Why this happens:**
- Git requires safe.directory for directories owned by different users
- Inside the container, the mounted project appears owned by a different user
- This is a security feature (CVE-2022-24765), not a bug

**To avoid modifying host gitconfig:**
Don't mount your host gitconfig into the container. The container creates its own gitconfig that is discarded when the container exits.
