## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Harness update policy now lives on the Harness descriptor**: Claude Code's `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` and pi's `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=true` join Copilot's `COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false` as `:runtime-env` entries, set exactly when their Harness is enabled. The precedence is `env` < `:runtime-env` < `docker_args`, so ordinary config cannot re-enable a self-updater against a read-only, pinned Harness volume while `docker_args` stays the deliberate escape hatch. `docs/adr/0008-harness-owned-runtime-environment-precedence.md` records it

- **`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` is no longer set in Sandboxes without Claude Code**: it used to go into every `docker run`, whatever was installed. Only Claude Code reads it, so nothing should change for you; the variable simply stops appearing where it had no reader

- **pi's version check is skipped in every pi Sandbox**: `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` was a host passthrough, so the check was only skipped for users who had already exported it. It is now set by aishell and dropped from the passthrough list — setting it on the host no longer does anything by itself

- **Gemini CLI and OpenCode get no update-check variable**: both expose the setting through their config files only (`general.enableAutoUpdate` in `~/.gemini/settings.json`, `autoupdate` in `opencode.json`), and aishell mounts those directories rather than writing to them. `docs/HARNESSES.md` says so under each Harness

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot CLI is a first-class Harness**: `aishell setup --with-copilot[=VERSION]` installs `@github/copilot` in the shared Harness volume, and `aishell copilot` or the in-Sandbox `copilot` alias launch it with the same configured defaults. Host `~/.copilot` persists login and settings. Only `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `COPILOT_GH_HOST` pass through automatically; broader GitHub credentials remain explicit opt-ins. Copilot permission prompts remain intact, while `COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false` keeps `aishell update` and version pins authoritative

- **aishell is now a single executable, and Docker is the only thing you install**: every release publishes one archive per platform (`aishell-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, `aishell-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`, `aishell-macos-amd64.tar.gz`, `aishell-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`, `aishell-windows-amd64.zip`), each holding a single file named `aishell` or `aishell.exe`, plus a `SHA256SUMS` file listing every asset the build produced. Each binary is the upstream babashka build for that platform with aishell's uberjar appended, so the interpreter ships with the program. `install.sh`, `install.ps1` and `install.bat` no longer download, detect or ask about babashka, and a Windows install is `aishell.exe` with no `.bat` shim beside it. The Linux binaries are statically linked, so they run on musl and on old glibc alike. Unpacking needs `tar` on Linux and macOS, and on Windows the `tar` that has shipped with Windows 10 since 1803, the same release that brought `curl`

- **The host runtime is pinned at babashka 1.13.220**: it lives in one constant in the build script, so every install runs the same interpreter rather than whichever `bb` was on the machine. That pin is separate from the foundation image's `BABASHKA_VERSION`, which is the babashka offered inside the sandbox and does not change here. The cost is size: 69 to 88 MB per binary on disk, where the old uberscript was 300 KB. The download is smaller because the native image compresses to about a third of that, 20 to 30 MB per archive

- **Nothing is code-signed yet**: downloads made by curl or PowerShell carry no quarantine flag and are unaffected, but an archive downloaded through a browser needs `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` on macOS or "Unblock" on Windows before it is extracted, and the README says so. Separately, appending the uberjar puts data past the macOS arm64 binary's own code signature, which may stop `aishell-macos-aarch64` running on Apple Silicon at all; that is open as aix-01m1mjm1vjd8 and the release smoke matrix is what answers it

- **`AISHELL_RELEASE_URL` points every download at an alternate release tree**: the three install scripts, `aishell upgrade` and the background update check all read it, so a release served from a local directory can be installed and upgraded against without reaching GitHub. It defaults to `https://github.com/UniSoma/aishell/releases`

- **`aishell upgrade` shows download progress when you are at a terminal**: 25-odd MB over a slow link looks like a hang otherwise. Attached to a terminal it shows curl's or wget's progress bar; from a script or a CI job it prints one line naming the asset and its size instead, so logs stay readable

- **Running aishell on your own babashka is documented**: `bbin install io.github.UniSoma/aishell` installs from the git repository, which is the route for people who would rather not have a second babashka on disk. The README lists it under Requirements, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` covers it

### Changed

- **`aishell upgrade` fetches the platform archive and converts a 4.0.0 script install in place**: it picks the asset for your OS and CPU architecture, verifies it against the release's `SHA256SUMS` before it unpacks or replaces anything, and installs the binary inside at the path that is already on your PATH, so a script install becomes a binary install without you moving a file. An upgraded 4.1.0 script install stays a script until the next upgrade, since a plain `aishell upgrade` stops at "already up to date"; `aishell upgrade 4.1.0` converts it right away. On Windows it writes `aishell.exe` and deletes the old `aishell` and `aishell.bat`, and prints a line saying it did. Windows also cannot overwrite a running executable, so upgrading a binary install parks the current `aishell.exe` as `aishell.exe.old` and the next start of aishell deletes the leftover; if the install then fails, the parked binary goes back, so PATH is never left with nothing on it. The decision behind all of that (asset name, destination path, which files to delete, whether the rename applies) is a pure function with unit tests over all five platforms and both install shapes

- **4.1.0 is a bridging release and still publishes `aishell`, `aishell.bat` and `aishell.sha256`**: an installed v4.0.0 asks for exactly those three names when it upgrades, so they have to exist for it to reach the binary release at all. **4.2.0 stops publishing them.** A v4.0.0 install therefore has to pass through 4.1.0, by running `aishell upgrade` while 4.1.0 is the newest release or `aishell upgrade 4.1.0` afterwards, or else re-run the install script. In the other direction, no version below 4.1.0 can be installed by a binary install's `upgrade`: those releases shipped a script that needs babashka, and their assets do not include a binary for any platform

- **The release workflow builds once, smoke-tests every binary, then publishes**: one Linux job builds all five targets and uploads them, a matrix job on `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-15-intel`, `macos-latest` and `windows-latest` checks its own archive against `SHA256SUMS`, unpacks it and runs `--version --json` on the binary inside, and only then does the release job create the GitHub release from the same artifacts the matrix ran. The existing `dry_run` input skips the release job alone, so a workflow change can be exercised end to end without publishing

### Fixed

- **bbin scripts no longer fail with `Permission denied` on `/tmp/bbinN` once another UID has used the sandbox**: every shim that `bbin install` generates writes its temp `deps.edn` to `(gensym "bbin")` under `/tmp`, and because `gensym` restarts its counter per process, every shim on the image lands on the same path, `/tmp/bbin190` today. The shim then `exec`s babashka, so the delete-on-exit hook never runs and the file stays behind. Once a copy at that path is owned by root or by a container started under a different host UID, every bbin script in the image fails with `java.io.FileNotFoundException: /tmp/bbin190 (Permission denied)` until someone removes it by hand. The foundation build now patches the five forms in `/usr/local/bin/bbin` to a per-user name, `bbin-<user>-N`, so UIDs no longer share a file, and fails the build if the substitution does not hit exactly five places, so a `BBIN_VERSION` bump that changes the form surfaces as a build error rather than a silent no-op. The entrypoint also removes `/tmp/bbin*` on every start, next to the sentinels it already clears. Upstream bbin still has the `gensym` form, so this is a workaround: every site is tagged `WORKAROUND(bbin-gensym-tmp)` so it can be dropped in one search once bbin fixes it. Rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash: one rebuild on your next `setup` or `update`, with the usual stale warning until then

- **A rejected download no longer destroys a working install**: all three install scripts wrote the download straight onto the install path and compared hashes only afterwards, so a corrupted or tampered file had already replaced a working aishell by the time it was refused, and the cleanup then deleted what was left. Each script now stages the download and the checksum file in a temporary directory of its own, `mktemp -d` in `install.sh` and a randomly named directory under the system temp path in `install.ps1` and `install.bat`, verifies the file there, and moves it onto the install path only once its hash matches. That also retires the fixed `/tmp/aishell.sha256` and `%TEMP%\aishell.sha256` paths, which two installs running at once could tread on

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **`aishell --verbose <command>` streams the output that used to hide behind a spinner**: image builds, harness volume population and Pi package installs all ran with their output captured, so a stalled step during `aishell claude` was indistinguishable from a hang — no progress, no error, nothing to read. A leading `--verbose` streams `docker build` and npm output as it happens, and also announces the configured `harness_args` defaults being applied. Only the leading position is consumed: `aishell --verbose claude` turns on aishell's verbosity, while `aishell claude --verbose` forwards the flag through to Claude Code, which has a `--verbose` of its own. `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` covers when to reach for it

### Removed

- **OpenSpec support is gone**: `--with-openspec` is now rejected as an unknown flag, and OpenSpec has been dropped from setup help, `harness_args` validation, `check`, `info`, the harness volume's npm installs, the `~/.config/openspec` mount and the `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` env var. A saved state that still carries `:with-openspec`/`:openspec-version` gets one warning on the next `setup`, `update`, or run, and the warning persists the stripped state so it does not repeat; the harness volume repopulates without OpenSpec on its own, because OpenSpec no longer contributes to the volume hash. Users who never enabled it see no change at all — the hash only ever covered enabled harnesses, so their volume does not rebuild. The repo's own `openspec/` change-proposal directory goes too: that workflow is dead, knot replaced it

### Changed

- **Babashka in the foundation image moves to 1.13.220, and on amd64 to the dynamically linked build**: the pin goes from 1.12.218 to the current upstream release, which adds the experimental `babashka.ffi` namespace on top of a run of `bb tasks` fixes — a task's own `:cli` spec no longer replaces the shared `:tasks {:cli {:spec ...}}` spec, `:depends` parsing and the dependency graph are tighter, and `pprint` custom dispatch writes to the pretty writer. FFI does not work on the static binary the image used to install: a statically linked glibc program cannot `dlopen`, so `load-system-library` and `load-library` both fail there, even given an absolute path to a library that exists. amd64 therefore switches to `babashka-${BABASHKA_VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, which needs only libc, libdl and libpthread — all in `libc6`, already present — and whose highest versioned symbol is `GLIBC_2.27`, comfortably under the image's 2.39 floor, so no new apt packages and no floor change. Upstream publishes no dynamic aarch64 build, so arm64 stays on the static binary and has no working FFI; the install step is now arch-aware like the CUE, uv and gitleaks steps beside it, which also fixes an amd64-only URL that would have installed an x86-64 `bb` on an arm64 build. Rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash: one rebuild on your next `setup` or `update`, with the usual stale warning until then

- **The foundation image now builds on `debian:trixie-slim`, and package names changed with it — check your own Dockerfiles**: the distro image moved from bookworm (glibc 2.36) to trixie (glibc 2.41), and the build now asserts a glibc floor of 2.39 on every rebuild, so a distro that silently regresses fails the build instead of failing a tool later. Two packages do not exist in trixie under their old names: `libreadline8` is now `libreadline8t64` (Debian's time_t transition) and `openjdk-17-jre-headless` is gone entirely, replaced by `openjdk-21-jre-headless` — bbin still gets the JRE it needs for `tools.deps` resolution, one major version newer. **If your `~/.aishell/Dockerfile` or a project extension installs apt packages, this is where it breaks**: those two names are the shape the breakage takes, and any other bookworm-only package name or version pin in your own layers will fail the same way. aishell's own CLI surface is unchanged. `docs/adr/0005-glibc-floor-on-the-distro-image.md` records the policy — the distro image carries a glibc floor as a first-class property, and when a tool outruns the floor we bump the distro rather than vendoring the tool per-case; `docs/adr/0004-sqlite-from-source-in-foundation-image.md` is amended to note that its glibc argument expired at 2.41 while the decision stands on its remaining reasons. SQLite is still compiled from source: trixie ships 3.46.1, still well behind the pinned 3.53.4. `aishell info` no longer hardcodes the distro — it scrapes it from the Dockerfile like every other version, and the report line is now `Distro:` rather than `Base:`, which also stops it colliding with `aishell:base`. Rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash: one rebuild on your next `setup` or `update`, with the usual stale warning until then

- **One foundation image rebuild on the next run**: the container entrypoint used to loop over a hardcoded list of harness alias variables, so a harness the list had never heard of got no shell alias inside the sandbox. It now picks up every `HARNESS_ALIAS_*` variable aishell hands it, and aishell builds that set from the harness registry. Editing the entrypoint changes the foundation image content, and aishell rebuilds the foundation image whenever that content changes, so your next `aishell update` or `aishell setup` rebuilds it once. Until then a plain run warns that the image is stale, as it does after any foundation change. Nothing else about the image changes

- **SQLite in the foundation image is now built from upstream source**: bookworm ships 3.40.1 (2022), and upstream's prebuilt tools cannot be used here — every binary in `sqlite-tools-linux-x64` needs `GLIBC_2.38` against bookworm's 2.36, there is no prebuilt shared library at all, and no prebuilt tools for arm64. A throwaway builder stage compiles 3.53.4 from the `sqlite-src` tree, giving `sqlite3`, `sqldiff` and `sqlite3_rsync` plus the shared library, header and pkg-config file under `/usr/local`. The library is `ldconfig`'d ahead of Debian's `libsqlite3-0`, deliberately shadowing it, so everything in the container that links `libsqlite3.so.0` gets 3.53.4 — not just whoever types `sqlite3`. The apt `sqlite3` package is dropped so two `sqlite3` binaries cannot coexist with `PATH` order picking the winner; `libsqlite3-0` stays, since other packages link it. Compile flags are a Debian-parity floor (FTS3/4/5, RTREE, SESSION, column metadata, `UPDATE`/`DELETE LIMIT`, soundex, secure delete, 250000 variables and the rest) plus `EXPLAIN_COMMENTS` and `BYTECODE_VTAB` — upstream defaults most features OFF, so a naive build would have shipped a newer SQLite with fewer features than the one it replaces. The build fails if the download does not match the pinned SHA-256, or if the installed library is missing any expected compile option. `libreadline8` joins the apt list to keep line editing in the shell at Debian parity. No TCL anywhere, which costs `sqlite3_analyzer` — the one tool that requires it. `docs/adr/0004-sqlite-from-source-in-foundation-image.md` records the decisions. Rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash

### Fixed

- **Typo suggestions now cover every subcommand**: the suggestion vocabulary was a hand-kept list that had fallen behind the dispatch table, so `aishell p1` suggested nothing and neither did a typo near the `a` attach alias. Suggestions and unknown-command detection now read the same command surface — aishell's own subcommands plus every harness in the registry — so a name aishell dispatches is a name it can suggest. Two rules keep the wider vocabulary useful: a candidate matches within three edits but never more edits than it has characters, so the one-letter `a` cannot absorb every piece of garbage input, and ties on edit distance break alphabetically, so the suggestion no longer depends on set iteration order

- **One label per harness across setup, update, info, check and help**: the same tool was "Codex" in a setup summary and "Codex CLI" in `info`, "Pi" in `check` and "Pi coding agent" in a launch error. Every one of those lines now prints the canonical label from the harness registry: Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi coding agent, Gitleaks. Three small output diffs come with it — `aishell update` now lists Gitleaks alongside the harnesses it was already reporting, the `UniSoma: enabled` line moves to the end of a setup summary instead of sitting after OpenCode, and the `gitleaks` line in `aishell --help` reads "Run Gitleaks"

- **Claude's skip-permissions rule is written once**: `aishell claude` and the `claude` alias inside the sandbox each spelled out when to add `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and how to read `AISHELL_SKIP_PERMISSIONS`, so the two could drift apart and give you a different Claude depending on how you started it. Both paths now build the launch command through the same registry function, which is also where Codex's `check_for_update_on_startup=false` flag and every harness's configured `harness_args` defaults are applied. Setting `AISHELL_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=false` turns the flag off for both, and any other value (or none) leaves it on

- **`harness_args` for a harness that cannot receive them now warns**: a `harness_args: {gitleaks: [...]}` entry was read, merged, and then quietly discarded when `aishell gitleaks` ran — the run path passed the command-line arguments straight through and never the configured defaults, while `--verbose` cheerfully announced "Applying gitleaks defaults". Gitleaks is not launched with configured defaults, so those defaults now produce a warning naming the harness and the ignored arguments, on every run rather than only under `--verbose`. Harnesses that do take defaults keep the verbose note they had. Loading the config warns too, and says the arguments are ignored rather than calling gitleaks an unknown harness, which it is not


## [3.23.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`aishell attach` infers the container when only one is running**: the name argument is now optional. With exactly one running container in the project, bare `aishell attach` (and `aishell attach -- <command>`) targets it and announces the pick on stderr — no more reading a name out of `aishell ps` and typing it back. Candidates are what `ps` shows, filtered to running; `vscode` containers are not special-cased and bootstrap state does not gate the pick, so the choice stays predictable from the `ps` output in front of you. Zero running errors with start guidance, the stopped container names, and a Docker hint (the listing cannot tell a dead daemon from an empty project); several running errors with each candidate's name and status plus a copyable `aishell attach <name>`. Explicit `aishell attach <name>` is unchanged and stays silent. `aishell exec` deliberately keeps requiring a name — it is non-interactive and often scripted, where an implicit target is a footgun

## [3.22.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Document and data tooling in the foundation image**: `poppler-utils` and `poppler-data` bring `pdftotext` (with `-layout` for tables), `pdftoppm`, `pdfinfo` and `pdfimages`, so agents can extract page ranges from large PDFs, preserve tabular structure, and rasterize pages — including CJK documents without embedded fonts. Alongside them, `libxml2-utils` (`xmllint` for XPath and validation), `moreutils` (`sponge`, `ts`, `chronic`, `ifne`), and `zip`/`zstd`/`xz-utils` round out archive handling next to the existing `unzip`. Roughly 42 MB installed, kept low because the bundled JRE already pays for the freetype/fontconfig/lcms2/jpeg/nss stack. The packages join the single existing apt layer — `aishell info --foundation` scrapes only the first install block, so a second layer would be silently invisible — and rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash. `docs/adr/0003-document-and-data-tooling-in-foundation-image.md` records the admission test now used to judge foundation additions, and what was rejected against it (pandoc at 168 MB; `yq`, which in bookworm is the Python wrapper, where babashka already bundles `clj-yaml`; tesseract, deferred)

### Changed

- **Refreshed the UniSoma OpenCode model whitelist**: the hard-coded list now tracks the current UniSoma model set — MiniMax M3, GLM 5.2, Kimi K2.6, Qwen3.7 Max, DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash, Claude Opus 5, Sonnet 5 and Haiku 4.5, Gemini 3.6 Flash and 3.1 Pro, Grok 4.5, the three GPT 5.6 variants (Sol, Terra, Luna), and GPT 5.4 Mini/Nano. Slugs follow OpenCode Zen naming, where dots come from each vendor's own version string, except Claude, which uses dashes throughout. Existing UniSoma users pick up the new list on the next `aishell update`, which re-upserts the whitelist

### Fixed

- **Git over ssh remotes works in the container again**: the foundation image installs its apt packages with `--no-install-recommends`, and Debian's `git` package carries `patch` and `ssh-client` as Recommends. `ca-certificates` and `less` were listed explicitly; the other two were silently dropped — so `git clone git@github.com:…`, `git fetch`, and `git push` against ssh remotes all failed with no ssh binary present, and `patch -p1` was unavailable. `openssh-client` and `patch` are now installed explicitly (~12 MB). `~/.ssh` is the canonical `mounts:` example in the config docs, so keys could already be mounted into an image with no client able to use them; `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` now documents that mount and its key-exposure trade-off. Rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash

## [3.21.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`uv` (Python toolchain) in the foundation image**: `uv`/`uvx` (v0.11.29) are baked into the base image as a single pinned static binary, alongside node/jq/cue. Binaries only, no baked interpreter — `uv` fetches the Python version a project pins on demand. The cache stays on `uv`'s HOME defaults; cross-session persistence is an opt-in per-project mount, documented rather than built in. Rebuild is automatic via the foundation-content hash
- **Opt-in per-project Claude machine-state isolation**: A new `claude_isolation` config key (`shared`|`project`, default `shared`) gives each sandbox its own `~/.claude` machine state keyed by project hash, instead of mounting the host `~/.claude` wholesale. Shared mode is byte-identical to today. In project mode a per-project dot-claude dir becomes the container `~/.claude`, with a built-in share allowlist mounted on top (skills, agents, commands, hooks, plugins, projects, `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `history.jsonl`, `.credentials.json`); `.credentials.json` is never seeded, mounted only when present, and promoted project-local → host when the host lacks it. A user-extensible `claude_shared_paths` allowlist merges additively, with a hard-reject guard against absolute paths, `..` escapes, and machine-state collisions. `aishell check` reports the effective mode, state-dir path/existence, and credentials source

### Changed

- **Toolchain bump**: CUE 0.17.1

### Fixed

- **`aishell info` now surfaces the `uv` version**: `uv`/`uvx` were added to the foundation image but `aishell info` never reported them. The `ARG UV_VERSION` is now parsed from the Dockerfile and printed in the Runtimes section alongside Node.js, Babashka, bbin, CUE, and gosu

## [3.20.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **`.sandbox/` alias for the project config dir**: A project-level `.sandbox/` directory is now a full alias for `.aishell/` (Dockerfile extension + `config.yaml`), for repos that want no "ai" naming in their tree. The active dir is resolved from the filesystem and threaded through `config`, `extension`, `run`, `check`, and `info`; path messages name the active dir. A project carrying both `.aishell/` and `.sandbox/` fails with a clear "use only one" error at the CLI boundary for every command. Scaffold one with `aishell setup --dir .sandbox` (`--dir` defaults to `.aishell`). The global config dir is unchanged — there is no `~/.sandbox/`, and a `.sandbox` repo still inherits `~/.aishell/config.yaml`

### Changed

- **Toolchain bump**: knot 0.9.0, with updated clj-surgeon and knot skill docs

### Fixed

- **First-time Claude Code login no longer loses credentials**: `~/.claude.json` was listed as a `:with-claude` config file but skipped by the host-side ensure step, so it was bind-mounted only if it already existed. First-time users had no host file, so Claude Code's login wrote credentials to `~/.claude.json` *inside* the container, discarded on removal. The ensure step now creates missing config files (seeding them with an empty JSON object so the harness doesn't choke on a zero-byte file), so the mount is present and login persists to the host

## [3.19.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **`aishell setup --reuse-config`**: Start from the saved setup intent and override only the flags passed on the current command — useful for foundation rebuilds (`--reuse-config --force`) and small per-tool overrides without `aishell update`'s unconditional harness-volume repopulation. Bare `--with-…` resets a tool to `latest`; `--with-…=VERSION` overrides an inherited version pin. Requires an existing saved setup in `~/.aishell/state.edn`
- **`:ready` boolean on `aishell ps`**: Derived single-signal answer to "is this container running and ready to use?" — `true` iff status is `Up` and `:bootstrap` is `:none` (no `pre_start`) or `:ready` (`pre_start` finalized). Saves callers from combining the status string with the four-state bootstrap field

### Changed

- **Toolchain bumps**: babashka 1.12.218, gitleaks 8.30.1

### Fixed

- **`aishell ps` readiness no longer lies for no-`pre_start` containers**: `:bootstrap` was `:none` and `:ready` flipped `true` the moment docker reported the container `Up`, but the entrypoint still had setup to do (recursive `chown` over shared bbin/Maven caches, alias-file generation). Consumers that `docker exec`'d in immediately — tmux launchers polling `aishell ps --json`, scripted attaches — could land before `~/.bash_aliases` was written, so `claude` ran without `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and configured `harness_args`. The entrypoint now touches `/tmp/aishell.entrypoint-done` right before `exec gosu`, and the probe gates `:bootstrap` / `:ready` on that sentinel for both `pre_start` and no-`pre_start` paths
- **Miscased `.aishell/Dockerfile` on Windows surfaces a warning**: NTFS resolves `DockerFile`/`dockerfile`/etc. case-insensitively, so the file appeared to exist client-side, but Docker Desktop's Linux daemon is case-sensitive and BuildKit failed with a cryptic `open Dockerfile: no such file or directory`. The mismatch is now detected and warned about before invoking the build, pointing at the rename fix

### Breaking

- **Containers must be recreated after upgrade**: existing containers were started by the previous entrypoint and never produced the new `/tmp/aishell.entrypoint-done` sentinel, so they will report `bootstrap: pending` indefinitely. `aishell down` + restart restores accurate readiness

## [3.18.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **`aishell attach <name> [-- <cmd>]`**: Run a command in the container, then drop into the shell — equivalent to attaching and typing the command manually. Argv is passed through verbatim via a bash `"$@"` wrapper, and the post-command shell launches whether the command succeeded or failed
- **`--json` output infrastructure**: Cross-cutting JSON wiring with `aishell ps --json` as the first supported command. JSON mode suppresses ANSI colors and silences interactive output (update check, migration warnings); per-command opt-in via `json-supported-subcommands`
- **`:bootstrap` field on `aishell ps`**: Per-container readiness state (`none` | `pending` | `ready` | `failed`) derived from `/tmp/pre-start.done` / `/tmp/pre-start.failed` sentinels written by the entrypoint. Non-running containers short-circuit to `:none`; failed rows surface a banner under the human table pointing at `/tmp/pre-start.log` (JSON mode stays banner-free)
- **Clojure agent toolchain in foundation image**: JDK 25, Clojure 1.12, clojure-lsp, clj-kondo, clojure-mcp-light, clj-surgeon, and the `knot` CLI

### Changed

- **Pi npm package renamed**: `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` → `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` following Pi's transfer to Earendil Works (announced at <https://pi.dev/news/2026/5/7/pi-has-a-new-home>). 0.73.1 was the final release on the old scope; 0.74.0 is the first on the new one. The `pi` CLI binary name is unchanged
- **Foundation image cache key**: Hash now covers every file `COPY`'d into the image (entrypoint, bashrc, profile.d, etc-profile) instead of only the Dockerfile, so entrypoint-only edits correctly invalidate the cache without needing `--force`

### Fixed

- **`aishell update` surfaces harness-volume removal failures**: `remove-volume` previously swallowed all Docker errors, so update would print "Repopulating harness volume" while reusing stale state — causing `npm install -g` to abort with EEXIST after package renames. Now distinguishes "no such volume" (fine) from "in use" / other errors (loud), naming the offending containers

### Removed

- **`src/aishell/migration.clj`**: Stub since v3.0.0 (when tmux support was dropped, retiring the v2.9 migration warning) — file and its three call sites in `cli.clj` deleted

## [3.17.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **CUE 0.16.1 in foundation image**: `cue` is now installed in the base image for data validation, configuration, and code generation. The version is surfaced in `aishell info` and listed among the image's installed tools in the README

### Fixed

- **PATH overrides in login shells**: Replace Debian's `/etc/profile` with a variant that only sets a default `PATH` when `PATH` is unset. The stock file unconditionally clobbers `PATH` for non-root login shells, silently discarding `ENV PATH` overrides from extending images — so a downstream `ENV PATH=/opt/jdk/bin:$PATH` worked in the entrypoint-launched shell but not in `aishell attach`

## [3.16.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **bbin in foundation image**: `bbin` (Babashka script installer) is now installed alongside `bb`. `BABASHKA_BBIN_BIN_DIR` is set to a shared `/usr/local/share/bbin/bin` so installs from an extending Dockerfile (root) and from the running container (developer user) land in the same place; the dir is on PATH for both interactive and exec'd shells, and the entrypoint chowns it to the host UID at runtime
- **Pre-warmed bbin caches**: the foundation image bakes in `clojure-tools.jar` (via `DEPS_CLJ_TOOLS_DIR=/usr/local/share/deps.clj/ClojureTools`) and bbin's Maven deps in `/usr/local/share/m2`, so the developer user no longer pays the cold-start dep download on first `bbin` invocation. Because `babashka.deps/add-deps` invokes deps.clj with `-Srepro` (which ignores user/project `deps.edn`), `:mvn/local-repo` cannot be set via config — instead `~/.m2/repository` is symlinked to the shared cache for both root (at build) and the developer user (in the entrypoint)
- **OpenJDK 17 JRE (headless)**: required by bbin for `tools.deps` dep resolution (`babashka.deps/add-deps`). Adds ~150–200MB to the foundation image but is necessary for `bbin install <pkg>` to work
- **rlwrap**: readline wrapper for line-editing in CLIs that don't ship readline support themselves (notably the Clojure `clj` REPL wrapper)

## [3.15.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- **Project section in `aishell info`**: New section showing the project directory, hash, container prefix, and resolved image tag (extended when a project Dockerfile exists, otherwise the base tag) — printed above the Foundation section

## [3.14.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Host config paths in `aishell info`**: New section showing the exact host directories mounted into the container for each enabled harness — helps users locate where tool configuration is persisted on their machine

## [3.13.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **UniSoma OpenCode provider**: New `--unisoma` flag on `aishell setup` that manages an OpenCode model whitelist for UniSoma users — automatically writes approved models to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, refreshes on `aishell update`, and removes the whitelist when disabled

## [3.12.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Windows upgrade**: Strip `.bat` extension from `fs/which` result during upgrade — on Windows, `fs/which "aishell"` returns `aishell.bat`, causing upgrade to overwrite the batch launcher with the Clojure script and save the new launcher to `aishell.bat.bat`, breaking all subsequent invocations

## [3.12.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Update check**: Time-based update check with configurable interval — notifies when a new version is available

### Fixed

- **Windows CLI flags**: Prevent Babashka from consuming CLI flags (e.g., `--version`, `--help`) on Windows — the `.bat` wrapper now uses `--` to separate `bb` flags from script arguments

## [3.11.2] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **Windows upgrade**: Use platform-appropriate null device (`NUL` on Windows, `/dev/null` on Unix) when checking latest version via curl — `aishell upgrade` was failing on PowerShell because `/dev/null` doesn't exist on Windows

## [3.11.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **Windows mount paths**: Normalize container mount destinations to forward slashes on Windows — backslash paths made harness config mounts (Claude, OpenCode, Codex, etc.) invisible inside the container, preventing auth and config persistence across sessions

## [3.11.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **OpenSpec support**: Mount `.config/openspec` directory for OpenSpec configuration persistence
- **OpenSpec telemetry**: Disable OpenSpec telemetry in container (`OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0`)
- **Config variable expansion**: Expand `$HOME`, `$UID`, `$GID`, `$USER` variables in config values

## [3.10.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Harness config persistence**: Auto-create harness config directories on host before mounting, so first-time harness users don't lose container configs on stop

## [3.10.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Codex startup**: Disable version check on startup to prevent EROFS errors on read-only filesystem

## [3.10.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Pi startup**: Resolve ENOENT error on Pi startup after aishell update

## [3.10.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Pi auto-install**: Automatically install configured Pi packages during setup

### Fixed

- **Docker worktree support**: Mount shared `.git` directory to enable `git worktree` inside containers
- **Toolchain integrity**: Mount harness volume read-only to prevent accidental modification of toolchain files
- **Doc drift and reviewed findings**: Resolve 9 reviewed findings and correct documentation drift

## [3.9.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **VSCode argument passthrough**: Extra arguments to `aishell vscode` are now passed through to the `code` CLI (e.g., `aishell vscode --profile Work`). Supports `harness_args.vscode` config for persistent defaults.
- **`aishell info --foundation`**: Print the embedded foundation Dockerfile

### Fixed

- **`aishell update` foundation staleness check**: Now always checks whether the foundation image is stale, not just when `--force` is passed

## [3.8.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **`--verbose` flag crashing `setup` and `update`**: Replaced non-blocking `p/process` with blocking `p/shell` in verbose code paths — volume population reported failure before the install process finished
- **Docker CLI v29 panic with `--progress=plain`**: Removed the flag from verbose Docker builds to avoid a BuildKit crash on certain Docker versions

## [3.8.0] - 2026-02-19

Global Base Image Customization. Users can customize the base image globally
by creating `~/.aishell/Dockerfile`, enabling a three-tier image chain that
cascades rebuilds automatically.

### Added

- **`aishell info` command**: Display image stack summary — foundation contents, base customization status, project extension status, and installed harnesses
- **Three-tier image chain**: `aishell:foundation` -> `aishell:base` -> `aishell:ext-{hash}` architecture
- **Global base image customization**: Create `~/.aishell/Dockerfile` to customize the base image for all projects
- **Lazy base image builds**: Base image builds automatically on first container run when global Dockerfile is detected
- **Cascade rebuilds**: Foundation change triggers base rebuild, which triggers extension rebuilds
- **`aishell check` base image status**: Shows whether base image is custom or default alias
- **`aishell setup --force` and `aishell update --force`**: Rebuild the base image alongside foundation
- **`aishell volumes prune`**: Cleans up orphaned custom base images
- **`FROM aishell:base` in project Dockerfiles**: Now recommended (inherits global customizations); `FROM aishell:foundation` also valid

### Changed

- Extension Dockerfiles now build on `aishell:base` (which may be customized) instead of directly on `aishell:foundation`
- Removed legacy `FROM aishell:base` validation error (it is now the recommended FROM line)

### Docs

- README.md updated with global base image feature mention
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with three-tier image chain, Docker labels, rebuild triggers, and cascade behavior
- CONFIGURATION.md updated with Global Base Image Customization section and 3 use case examples
- HARNESSES.md updated with base image customization note
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated with base image build failures and reset procedure
- DEVELOPMENT.md updated with docker/base.clj module documentation

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-18

OpenSpec as an opt-in development workflow tool. Build with `--with-openspec`
to make the `openspec` command available inside containers.

### Added

- **OpenSpec support**: Opt-in development workflow tool via `--with-openspec` build flag
  - `aishell setup --with-openspec` to include OpenSpec in harness volume
  - Version pinning with `--with-openspec=VERSION`
  - `openspec` command available inside container when enabled
  - `aishell check` shows OpenSpec installation status and version
  - `aishell update` refreshes OpenSpec when enabled
- **OpenSpec documentation**: All 6 user-facing docs updated (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONFIGURATION, HARNESSES, TROUBLESHOOTING, DEVELOPMENT)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-18

Per-harness security scoping. API keys and config directory mounts are now
limited to only the harnesses you enable, reducing the blast radius of
prompt injection attacks.

### Changed

- **Per-harness API key scoping**: Only API keys required by enabled harnesses are passed into the container (e.g., `--with-claude` only passes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, not `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- **Per-harness config mount scoping**: Only config directories for enabled harnesses are mounted (e.g., `~/.gemini` is not mounted unless `--with-gemini` is enabled)
- **GCP credentials mount gated on Gemini**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` file mount only active when `--with-gemini` is enabled

### Removed

- **Cross-cutting keys removed from auto-passthrough**: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_PROFILE` are no longer passed through automatically — add them via `config.yaml` `env:` section if needed

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-18

Pi coding agent as a first-class harness. Build with `--with-pi`, run with
`aishell pi`, same UX as Claude/Codex/Gemini.

### Added

- **Pi coding agent support**: Run Mario Zechner's Pi coding agent in the sandbox
  - `aishell setup --with-pi` to include Pi in harness volume
  - `aishell pi [args]` to run Pi directly (e.g., `aishell pi --print "hello"`)
  - Version pinning with `--with-pi=VERSION`
  - `~/.pi/` config directory mounted automatically for auth persistence
  - `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` environment variables passed through
  - `pi` shell alias available inside container
  - `aishell check` shows Pi installation status and version
  - `aishell --help` lists `pi` command when installed
- **fd in foundation image**: `fd-find` package with `fd` symlink pre-installed for Pi's file discovery
- **OPENCODE_API_KEY passthrough**: OpenCode Zen model router API key passed through to container

### Docs
- README.md updated with Pi in harness list, setup/run examples, authentication, and env vars
- HARNESSES.md updated with complete Pi section (overview, install, auth, usage, env vars, config, tips) and comparison table
- CONFIGURATION.md updated with `--with-pi` flag and `harness_args.pi` examples
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with Pi in system diagram, volume contents, state schema, and fd in foundation
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated with Pi version checks and credential persistence
- DEVELOPMENT.md updated with Pi as reference implementation in harness integration guide

## [3.4.3] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Attach alias**: `aishell a` as shorthand for `aishell attach`

### Fixed
- **PowerShell compatibility**: ASCII fallbacks for Unicode check/cross symbols on legacy PowerShell versions

## [3.4.2] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **VSCode server persistence**: Mount `~/.vscode-server` into container so extensions and cached data survive restarts

### Fixed
- **VSCode multi-instance**: Multiple `aishell vscode` instances can now run simultaneously, each in a dedicated window
- **WSL2 backslash mangling**: Use `p/process` instead of `p/shell` for `wslpath` to prevent bash from mangling Windows backslashes in imageConfigs path resolution

### Changed
- **VSCode imageConfig**: `ensure-imageconfig!` now only defaults `remoteUser` when missing — no longer overwrites user-customized values or syncs host extensions (VSCode handles extension sync natively via Dev Containers)

## [3.4.1] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **WSL2 imageConfigs path**: `aishell vscode` now writes imageConfigs to the Windows filesystem (`%APPDATA%\Code\...`) when running from WSL2, so VSCode correctly picks up the per-image configuration

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-14

Self-upgrade command and improved setup diagnostics.

### Added
- **`aishell upgrade` command**: Self-upgrade aishell by downloading the latest (or specific) release from GitHub with SHA-256 checksum verification
- **Version downgrade support**: `aishell upgrade 3.2.0` warns but allows downgrading
- **VSCode imageConfigs path in `aishell check`**: Shows the directory path for VSCode per-image configuration

## [3.3.0] - 2026-02-13

VSCode integration for opening containers with zero manual configuration.

### Added
- **`aishell vscode` subcommand**: Open VSCode attached to the container as the `developer` user with automatic per-image config
- **Host extension sync**: Automatically discovers locally installed VSCode extensions and makes them available inside the container
- **Wait mode (default)**: `aishell vscode` blocks until VSCode closes, then stops the container
- **Detach mode**: `aishell vscode --detach` runs the container in the background
- **Stop command**: `aishell vscode --stop` stops a detached vscode container
- **Tools check in `aishell check`**: Reports availability of `code` CLI and `git`

### Changed
- `resolve-image-tag` in `run.clj` is now public so `vscode.clj` can resolve extended images consistently

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-13

Simplified installation and improved Docker Dev Container support.

### Added
- **Auto-install Babashka**: `install.sh` now automatically downloads and installs Babashka if not present
- **Windows PowerShell installer**: `install.ps1` for one-command Windows installation with automatic Babashka setup
- **Windows CMD installer**: `install.bat` for native cmd.exe installation support
- **Docker build-time user**: Developer user pre-created in Dockerfile for VSCode Dev Container compatibility

### Changed
- Docker entrypoint adjusts pre-existing developer user UID/GID via `usermod`/`groupmod` instead of creating from scratch at runtime
- Install script examples updated to use `opencode` as the default AI tool

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-12

Native Windows host support. aishell now runs from cmd.exe and PowerShell with
Linux containers via Docker Desktop WSL2 backend. No Dockerfile or entrypoint
changes needed.

### Added
- **Platform detection**: `babashka.fs/windows?` guards all Unix-specific code paths (`id` command, `p/exec`, Unix path assumptions)
- **Cross-platform path utilities**: `get-home` returns `USERPROFILE` on Windows, `HOME` on Unix; `expand-path` handles backslash paths; state/config uses `LOCALAPPDATA` on Windows
- **Docker mount normalization**: Windows drive letter support (`C:\path:destination`), automatic forward-slash conversion via `fs/unixify` for Docker Desktop compatibility
- **Windows UID/GID defaults**: UID/GID default to 1000/1000 on Windows without calling `id -u`/`id -g`
- **Windows process execution**: `p/process` with `:inherit` on Windows for full I/O inheritance; `System/exit` for exit code propagation to parent shell
- **ANSI color detection**: Standards-compliant NO_COLOR > FORCE_COLOR > auto-detection priority; Windows Terminal (`WT_SESSION`) and ConEmu (`ConEmuANSI=ON`) recognized as ANSI-capable
- **Windows .bat wrapper**: `dist/aishell.bat` generated in build pipeline using neil-pattern (4-line minimal wrapper with CRLF endings); included in GitHub Release assets

### Changed
- `colors-enabled?` in `output.clj` is now public for cross-module use
- Git identity extraction (`git config user.name/user.email`) works on Windows git installations

### Docs
- README.md updated with side-by-side Windows installation instructions (Docker Desktop, Babashka via Scoop, .bat wrapper)
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with cross-platform design patterns and platform detection ADR
- CONFIGURATION.md updated with Windows path examples and forward-slash normalization notes
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated with Windows-specific issues section (path normalization, ANSI colors, process execution)
- DEVELOPMENT.md updated with Windows testing section (5 platform-specific test scenarios)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-06

Remove tmux from containers entirely. Window management belongs on the host.
Attach simplified to `docker exec`, CLI streamlined with always-foreground containers.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **tmux removed**: `--with-tmux` build flag, tmux binary, tmux plugins, and tmux-resurrect persistence all removed from containers
- **Attach rewritten**: `aishell attach <name>` now uses positional argument syntax (was `aishell attach --name <name>`)
- **`--session` and `--shell` flags removed** from attach command (no tmux sessions to manage)
- **`--detach`/`-d` flag removed**: Containers always run foreground-attached; use host window management for background execution
- **`tmux:` config section removed**: `tmux.plugins` and `tmux.resurrect` config keys no longer recognized
- **State schema v3.0.0**: `:with-tmux`, `:tmux-plugins`, and `:resurrect-config` keys removed from state

### Changed
- **Entrypoint simplified**: Single execution path via `exec gosu` (no conditional tmux fork), ~80 lines of dead code removed
- **`--name` flag extended**: `aishell --name foo` now works in shell mode (creates container named "foo" running bash)
- **Foundation image**: tmux binary and `/etc/tmux.conf` no longer installed, reducing image size
- **Volume hash**: No longer includes tmux state; volumes keyed solely by harness tools
- **`skip-tmux` renamed to `skip-interactive`**: Internal parameter now reflects broader purpose (controls harness aliases)

### Removed
- `--with-tmux` build flag and all tmux-related state tracking
- `WITH_TMUX` environment variable from container runtime
- tmux config mounting (`~/.tmux.conf`)
- TPM and plugin installation from harness volumes
- Resurrect mounts from docker run
- tmux conditional logic from entrypoint (~80 lines)
- tmux Architecture section from ARCHITECTURE.md (~90 lines)
- tmux Issues section from TROUBLESHOOTING.md (~160 lines)
- Detached Mode & tmux section from HARNESSES.md (replaced with Multi-Container Workflow)

### Docs
- README.md updated with docker exec attach semantics and new container naming
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated: removed tmux section, simplified entrypoint flow (10 steps to 5)
- CONFIGURATION.md updated: removed tmux config section and `--with-tmux` setup
- HARNESSES.md updated: replaced tmux section with Multi-Container Workflow
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated: removed tmux Issues section, simplified Attach Issues
- DEVELOPMENT.md verified clean (no changes needed)

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-05

Flip Gitleaks from opt-out to opt-in. Users who want Gitleaks scanning must explicitly request it at build time.

### Changed
- **Gitleaks is now opt-in**: `aishell setup --with-gitleaks` enables Gitleaks; default behavior is no Gitleaks (previously always installed)
- **Consistent flag pattern**: Replaced `--without-gitleaks` with `--with-gitleaks`, establishing positive `--with-*` pattern across all build options
- **Conditional warnings**: Gitleaks staleness warning only shown when Gitleaks is installed (no irrelevant warnings for users without Gitleaks)

### Fixed
- Gitleaks freshness warning no longer appears for users who build without `--with-gitleaks`

### Docs
- README.md updated with opt-in Gitleaks semantics and `--with-gitleaks` flag
- CONFIGURATION.md updated with `--with-gitleaks` section (was `--without-gitleaks`)
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md updated with "gitleaks command not found" resolution
- ARCHITECTURE.md updated with opt-in design principles and build diagram

## [2.9.2] - 2026-02-03

### Changed
- **Renamed `build` to `setup`**: The `aishell build` command is now `aishell setup` across the CLI, help text, error messages, and documentation. Internal Docker build logic is unchanged.

### Fixed
- Correct `aishell shell` to `aishell` in install script

### Docs
- Add llm.txt and UX analysis artifacts
- Restructure README for clearer reading order and tighter prose

## [2.9.1] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Harness alias injection**: Typing `claude`, `opencode`, etc. in an interactive container session now applies the same `harness_args` from config as `aishell claude` would
  - Claude alias always includes `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  - Aliases persist across tmux new-window via profile.d sourcing
  - Bypass with `command claude` or `\claude`

### Fixed
- `pre_start` config now uses array format for consistency with other config fields
- Bypass tmux wrapping for `exec` and `gitleaks` commands (skip-tmux guard)
- Resurrect plugin not loading: `populate-volume` now uses pre-computed `tmux-plugins` from state instead of recalculating from raw config
- Attach command defaults to `harness` session name (was hardcoded to `main` in CLI parser)
- Nil guard added to `parse-resurrect-config` to prevent spurious warnings

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-03

Make tmux fully opt-in with plugin management, user config mounting, and session persistence.

### Changed
- **tmux is now opt-in**: `aishell build --with-tmux` enables tmux; default behavior is no tmux (previously always enabled since v2.7.0)
- **Session name**: tmux session renamed from `main` to `harness` for project naming consistency
- **Attach command**: `aishell attach` now connects to `harness` session by default

### Added
- **`--with-tmux` build flag**: Opt-in to tmux integration at build time, stored in state.edn
- **tmux config mounting**: User's `~/.tmux.conf` auto-mounted read-only into container when tmux is enabled
- **Plugin management**: Declare tmux plugins in `.aishell/config.yaml` under `tmux.plugins` list
  - Format: `owner/repo` (e.g., `tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible`)
  - TPM installed into harness volume at `/tools/tmux/plugins/tpm`
  - Plugins installed non-interactively during `aishell build` / `aishell update`
  - Plugin format validated during config parsing
  - Runtime bridging via symlink from volume to `~/.tmux/plugins`
  - TPM initialization appended to tmux config at container startup
- **tmux-resurrect support**: `tmux.resurrect` config section for session state persistence
  - `resurrect: true` enables with sensible defaults (layout only, no process restoration)
  - Per-project state directory at `~/.aishell/resurrect/{project-hash}/`
  - tmux-resurrect plugin auto-injected when resurrect enabled
  - `restore_processes: true` to opt-in to full process restoration
- **Migration warning**: Users upgrading from v2.7-2.8 see one-time warning about tmux behavior change
- **Attach validation**: `aishell attach` shows helpful error when tmux is not enabled

### Fixed
- Missing `~/.tmux.conf` on host handled gracefully (no error, just skipped)

### Internal
- State schema: added `:with-tmux` field
- Volume hash includes tmux state for proper cache invalidation
- `WITH_TMUX` env var passed to container (simpler than mounting state.edn)
- Migration detection uses state schema shape (presence without `:harness-volume-hash`)
- Marker file at `~/.aishell/.migration-v2.9-warned` prevents repeat warnings

## [2.8.1] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- Set terminal window title (OSC 2) before foreground container launch for easier window identification in Alt+Tab

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-01

Split monolithic base image into stable foundation layer and volume-mounted harness tools.
Harness version updates no longer force multi-gigabyte extension rebuilds.

### Changed
- **Architecture:** 2-tier system — foundation image (Debian, Node.js, system tools) + harness volume (npm packages, binaries)
- **`aishell update`:** Now refreshes harness volume only (delete + recreate for clean slate). Use `--force` to also rebuild foundation image.
- **Image tag:** `aishell:base` renamed to `aishell:foundation` (backward-compat error message guides migration)
- **Extension cache:** Invalidation now uses foundation image ID, not base image ID

### Added
- **`aishell volumes`** command to list harness volumes with active/orphaned status
- **`aishell volumes prune`** to remove orphaned harness volumes
- **`aishell update --force`** flag to rebuild foundation image alongside volume refresh
- **OpenCode binary installation** via GitHub releases (separate from npm harnesses)
- **Volume-based harness tools** mounted read-only at `/tools` in containers
- **`/etc/profile.d/aishell.sh`** for tmux new-window environment consistency
- Harness volume labels for metadata (hash, version, harness list)

### Fixed
- Harness version updates no longer invalidate Docker extension cache
- tmux new-window sessions now inherit harness tool PATH correctly

### Internal
- State schema: added `foundation-hash`, `harness-volume-hash`, `harness-volume-name` fields
- `dockerfile-hash` deprecated in favor of `foundation-hash` (still written for backward compat)
- Foundation image builds only on Dockerfile template changes
- Per-project volumes keyed by harness combination hash (shared across identical configs)

## [2.7.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Shell access flag**: `aishell attach --name <name> --shell` opens a bash shell in a running container
  - Creates or reattaches to a tmux session named `shell` using `tmux new-session -A`
  - Mutually exclusive with `--session` flag

### Fixed

- **Attach color support**: Pass `COLORTERM` env var in attach commands, matching `docker run` behavior
- **Attach bashrc setup**: Ensure `/etc/bash.aishell` is sourced when attaching to containers started with harness commands (e.g., `claude`), restoring custom prompt and color aliases

## [2.7.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **tmux integration**: All container modes auto-start inside tmux session `main`
  - Enables detach/reattach workflow for long-running AI agents
  - TERM validation with automatic fallback to xterm-256color for unsupported terminals (e.g., Ghostty)
  - gosu runs before tmux to ensure user-owned socket (no permission errors)

- **Named containers**: Deterministic container naming with `aishell-{project-hash}-{name}` format
  - Project hash is first 8 chars of SHA-256 of project directory path
  - Default name equals harness name (`claude`, `opencode`, `codex`, `gemini`, `shell`)
  - Override with `--name <name>` flag (e.g., `aishell claude --name reviewer`)

- **Detached mode**: `--detach` / `-d` flag for background container execution
  - `aishell claude --detach` starts container in background and prints attach/stop commands
  - `--rm` flag preserved (containers auto-cleanup when stopped)

- **Conflict detection**: Pre-flight checks before container launch
  - Running container with same name produces clear error with attach guidance
  - Stopped container with same name auto-removed before new launch

- **Attach command**: `aishell attach --name <name>` reconnects to running containers
  - `--session <session>` flag for specific tmux sessions
  - Three-layer validation: TTY check, container state, session existence
  - User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

- **PS command**: `aishell ps` lists running containers for current project
  - Table output with NAME (short form), STATUS, and CREATED columns
  - Project-scoped filtering by project hash
  - Helpful empty state message with examples

- **Pre-flight check command**: `aishell check` validates configuration, Docker availability, and image state before running

### Fixed

- **Glob pattern matching in allowlist**: Replaced broken `fs/match` with Java NIO `PathMatcher` for correct single-path glob evaluation

## [2.5.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **One-off command execution**: Run commands in container without interactive shell
  - `aishell exec <command>` runs command and exits
  - Automatic TTY detection (works in terminals and pipes/scripts)
  - Exit code propagation from container to host
  - Skips detection warnings and pre_start hooks for fast execution
  - Piping support: `echo "test" | aishell exec cat`

- **Dynamic help output**: Help shows only installed harness commands
  - Reads build state to determine which harnesses are available
  - Shows all harnesses when no build exists (aids discoverability)
  - Gitleaks always shown (may work via host installation)

- **Conditional Gitleaks installation**: `--without-gitleaks` build flag
  - Skip Gitleaks installation to reduce image size (~15MB savings)
  - State tracked as `:with-gitleaks` in `~/.aishell/state.edn`

- **Filename-based pattern detection** for 20+ sensitive file types:
  - Environment files: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.envrc`
  - SSH keys: `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ed25519`, `id_ecdsa`, `*.ppk`
  - Key containers: `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore`

  - Default threshold: 7 days (configurable via `gitleaks_freshness_days`)
  - Disable with `gitleaks_freshness_check: false` in config
- **Gitignore awareness**: High-severity files not in `.gitignore` show "(risk: may be committed)"
